This code snippet checks the time values `h`, `m`, and `s` and ensures that they are properly formatted by calling the `checkTime` function on each of them.

```javascript
  h = checkTime(h);
  m = checkTime(m);
  s = checkTime(s);
```

This code snippet checks if a number `i` is less than 10, and if so, adds a '0' in front of it.

```javascript
const checkTime = (i) => {
  // add zero in front of numbers < 10
  if (i < 10) {
    i = `0${i}`;
  }
```
